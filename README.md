# Your first Polymer element

This repo goes with the [Build your first Polymer element tutorial](https://www.polymer-project.org/3.0/start/first-element/intro).

## Running the tutorial code

1. You'll need to install some command-line tools to manage dependencies and to run the demo. See the [full installation instructions on the Polymer website](https://www.polymer-project.org/2.0/docs/tools/polymer-cli).

3.  Clone this repo:

        https://github.com/PolymerLabs/polymer-3-first-element.git
        
4.  Change directory to your local repo and install dependencies with `bower`:

        cd polymer-3-first-element
        yarn install
        
5.  To preview your element, run the Polymer development server from the repo directory:

        polymer serve --npm
        
    Open `localhost:8080/demo/index.html` in your browser.
